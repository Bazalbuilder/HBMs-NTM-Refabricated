Any feature requests you wish to see in this fork, whether it's from the main or another repository relating to HBM, should
go to the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Bazalbuilder/HBMs-NTM-Refabricated/issues/new) or our Discord server (TODO).

If you are willing to do the work yourself, please open up a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/Bazalbuilder/HBMs-NTM-Refabricated/compare).

Make sure you have including the following:
* A clear description of the feature you are requesting;

### Pull Requests
While doing a Pull Request, make sure you are following these guidelines:
* Keep it concise: If you want to add multiple features, then open up pull requests for each feature. Do not cram features into
a single PR.
* Test your code: Make sure before opening up a new PR, that you have tested your code.
* Communication is key: If you are planning on doing a grand change, please communicate with me on my Discord server.

### Code Style
No definitive style guide at the moment.

### CHANGELOG.md
Let me edit the changelog, I bet you have other stuff you need to do. Besides, I need to verify there's no malicious code
in my repository (I'm looking at you, TBS).

### Testing
Testing is not implemented at this time. If it is implemented, it will require JUnit.
